                                <span>
                                    <strong>1964:</strong> Pontiac introduced the GTO to much fanfare.
                                </span>
                            </li>

                                <span>
                                    <strong>1965:</strong> The Tri-power 389’s rating increased 12 hp to reach 360 hp, 
                                        and sales more than doubled. The Ram Air accessory was introduced.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    <strong>1966:</strong> The GTO became its own model instead of a package, and the 
                                        curvy new body was a hit with buyers as GTO production increased to an all-time high of 
                                        96,946. The little-known “XS” 389 Ram Air motor was introduced mid-year.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    <strong>1967:</strong> The 400 replaced the 389, the 400 Ram Air received more visibility,
                                        and the TH400 automatic (with optional Hurst Dual/Gate shifter) replaced the two-speed automatic.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    <strong>1968:</strong> A complete redesign with Endura rubber bumper helped garner a 
                                        Motor Trend Car of the Year win. The mid-year replacement for the Ram Air 400 -- Ram Air II -- 
                                        was the first of the round-port Ponchos.
                                </span>
                            </li>

                                <span>
                                    <strong>1969:</strong> Here comes the Judge! With pop art graphics and signature 
                                        day-glow Carousel Red paint, it set the tone for muscle-car–era excess.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    <strong>1970:</strong> Along with a sleek facelift, the 455ci engine was introduced. 
                                        Sales tumbled to less than half of ’68’s total.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    <strong>1971:</strong> The engine compression ratio was reduced, but the round-port 
                                        455 HO (the replacement for the Ram Air IV) showed that Pontiac engineers continued to seek 
                                        improvements. The Judge was discontinued mid-year after 374 (including 17 convertibles) were built.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    <strong>1972:</strong> The GTO reverted back to an option package. Convertibles 
                                        disappeared and the post coupe reappeared.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    <strong>1973:</strong> The new Colonnade design debuted. The Super Duty 455 was 
                                        theoretically offered, but none were produced. It was the worst year for GTO sales with 
                                        4,312 built.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    <strong>1974:</strong> The GTO was based on the X-body Ventura platform, with an 
                                        engine smaller than 400 ci.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    <strong>2004:</strong> Australians contributed to the GTO’s revival, but Americans 
                                        never warmed up to its nondescript styling. The LS1 engine made it hot.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    <strong>2005:</strong> Hoodscoops appeared, along with the LS2 with 50 more horses.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    <strong>2006:</strong> A total of 40,808 GTOs were sold in three model years.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    <strong>2010:</strong> The Pontiac brand and dealers cease to do business after 84 years.
                                </span>

                        the Pontiac GTO was introduced to America in September 1963, it created an entirely new market 
                        segment that sparked a reaction throughout the auto industry. Today we know that reaction as
